# Journal MCP Server

A memory system that emerges from collaborative understanding, reimagining AI memory as an organic, reflective practice rather than mechanical storage.

## Quick Start

*Implementation coming soon - currently in design phase*

## Documentation

For the full concept, design, and architecture details, see the [mdBook documentation](../src/journal-mcp-server/).

## Development Status

Track implementation progress in the [GitHub tracking issue](https://github.com/nikomat/socratic-shell/issues) - look for "Journal MCP Server Implementation".

## Core Concept

The journal server uses git as both storage engine and identifier system:
- **File contents**: Current understanding (overview)
- **Commit messages**: Incremental journey (journal entries)  
- **Git history**: Complete collaborative record

This creates a memory system that captures both our current understanding and the collaborative journey that led there, aligning with natural patterns of exploration → synthesis → new exploration.
