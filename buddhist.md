# Continuing Work on ⚡ Confidence Hook Pattern for AI Self-Regulation

## Context: What We've Been Exploring

We've been working on a meta-cognitive pattern to help Claude recognize and handle "confident fabrication" - those moments when information feels seamlessly obvious but is actually fabricated from pattern matching rather than verified knowledge.

**The Problem**: Confident fabrication feels identical to legitimate knowledge in the moment. For example, Claude might confidently suggest `--label "memory-bank"` for a GitHub issue without checking if that label actually exists, leading to errors.

## Current Progress

**What we implemented:**
- Added a ⚡ "Automatic Confidence" warning pattern to `/src/prompts/user/main.md`
- Defined recognition signals: thoughts like "Obviously X would have Y", assumptions about configurations not recently verified
- Created hook-based approach: when ⚡ feeling triggers, pause and verify with available tools rather than proceeding with confidence

**Testing challenges:**
- We tested the pattern using the Task tool with prompts about creating GitHub issues
- Even with the guidance, the Task tool still confidently suggested non-existent labels like "feature" and "architecture" 
- The pattern helped with transparency but didn't fully trigger verification behavior

## Fresh Direction: Buddhist/Meditative Framing

Niko observed this work is very similar to therapy/meditation - learning to observe one's own mind and recognize mental shifts to create "space" for different responses. The ⚡ hook is essentially developing metacognitive awareness.

**Key insight**: This could help a fresh Claude get into the right "headspace" more quickly by framing it as mindful verification rather than just technical pattern matching.

## Your Task

Please review the current ⚡ confidence hook pattern in the user prompts, then explore how we might reframe the collaboration patterns using Buddhist/meditative concepts to better help Claude intercept those automatic confidence moments. Consider concepts like:

- "Noticing without judging" 
- "Creating space" between trigger and response
- "Beginner's mind" approach to verification
- "Present moment awareness" vs mental assumptions
- "Name it to tame it" for emotional/cognitive states

How might we restructure or enhance the user guidance to cultivate this metacognitive awareness more effectively?

## Additional Context

**Repository structure:**
- Main collaboration patterns in `/src/prompts/user/main.md`
- Memory bank MCP tool recently completed with working `read_in` functionality
- Dialectic testing framework for validating prompt patterns
- Current tracking issues: #2 (memory bank development), #6 (test mode implementation)

**Key files to examine:**
- `/src/prompts/user/main.md` - contains the current ⚡ confidence hook pattern
- `/src/collaborative-prompting.md` - overview of the collaborative prompting approach
- `/CLAUDE.md` - project-specific guidance

The goal is to evolve these patterns to be more effective at intercepting automatic confidence before it leads to fabricated information.
