## Memory Bank Design Context

@src/memory-bank/README.md

### Maintenance & Workflow
The mdBook whose table of contents lies in `src/SUMMARY.md` must be kept current as design evolves.
The table of contents can be useful to find sources of additional information about the memory bank design.

### Checkpointing

When asked to "checkpoint our work", remember to take the following steps:
- Update [Current Design State](./src/memory-bank/current-state.md) with new insights/discoveries  
- Move completed items from Open Questions to Key Design Decisions
- Document new principles discovered in the [Design Foundation](./src/memory-bank/design-foundation.md)
- Add new questions to cover design pivots in the [FAQ](./src/memory-bank/faq.md)
