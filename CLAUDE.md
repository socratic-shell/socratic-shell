# CLAUDE.md

## Overview

The Socratic Shell documents my journey trying to build a collaborative partner that can empower me to tackle anything and everything.

The repository combines an mdbook (found in `src`) with various code experiments. A summary of everything we are doing can be found in the mdbook summary:

@src/SUMMARY.md

## Conventions for working in this project

When exploring new ideas, we keep most of our documentation in the mdbook, including goals, architectural design, and key implementation details.

However, we do not use the mdbook to store transient information like the set of ongoing tasks. Those are maintained in github issues:

@src/prompts/project/github-tracking-issues.md

When writing code, we use AI insight comments to capture key insights:

@src/prompts/project/ai-insights.md
