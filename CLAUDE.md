# CLAUDE.md

## Overview

The Socratic Shell documents my journey trying to build a collaborative partner that can empower me to tackle anything and everything.

The repository combines an mdbook (found in `src`) with various code experiments. A summary of everything we are doing can be found in the mdbook summary. The appendix includes a list of references that collect research reports or other material which can be useful to future conversations; feel free to fetch that material during our conversation if you'd like to refresh your memory on something.

## Conventions for working in this project

When exploring new ideas, we keep most of our documentation in the mdbook, including goals, architectural design, and key implementation details.

However, we do not use the mdbook to store transient information like the set of ongoing tasks. Those are maintained in github issues on the repository `socratic-shell/socratic-shell`:

@src/prompts/project/github-tracking-issues.md

When writing code, we use AI insight comments to capture key insights:
