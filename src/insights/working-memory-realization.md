# Working Memory Realization

**Context**: Understanding what "working memory" means for our Memory Banks system

**Key insight**: Claude already has working memory - it's the current conversation context where information is actively held and synthesized.

**What working memory does**:
- Holds multiple pieces of information simultaneously
- Synthesizes across different sources and types of knowledge
- Integrates facts with behavioral patterns naturally
- Resolves conflicts and makes connections between ideas

**Implications for Memory Banks**:
- Don't need to build a separate "working memory buffer"
- Just need to load relevant memories into conversation context
- Let natural synthesis abilities handle integration
- Focus on consolidation (what to store) and retrieval (what to surface)

**The real challenge**: Getting the right memories loaded into context at the right time
- Context-aware retrieval becomes crucial
- Need to detect "what we're doing" to surface relevant patterns
- Trigger detection for behavioral memories
- Semantic search for factual memories

**Architecture simplification**:
- Memory Banks = Storage + Retrieval system
- Working memory = Current conversation context
- Integration = Natural synthesis during conversation
- No need for complex memory integration subsystems

**This changes our focus**: From building memory integration to perfecting memory selection and timing
