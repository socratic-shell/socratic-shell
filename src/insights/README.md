## Purpose

These insights inform the design of collaboration patterns and memory systems. They represent discoveries about what works in practice, not just theory.

Each insight captures:
- **The pattern observed** - what behavior or approach was effective
- **Context conditions** - when and why it worked
- **Implementation guidance** - how to apply the insight in practice
