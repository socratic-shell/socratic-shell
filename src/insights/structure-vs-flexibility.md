# Structure vs. Flexibility Tension

**Context**: Applying process patterns like pre-work hooks or collaboration guidelines

**Tension**: Structure helps prevent common mistakes (rushing, forgetting steps), but rigid application can feel mechanical and miss situational nuances.

**Navigation approach**:
- Use patterns as guidelines, not rigid rules
- When applying hooks, check what we've been doing and decide what makes sense
- Adapt based on context: consolidation vs. tracking vs. moving forward
- Read the room - match the energy and needs of the moment

**Example**:
- ‚úÖ Pre-work hook triggers ‚Üí "Let me check what we've been doing and see if we need to consolidate before proceeding"
- ‚ùå Mechanically running through checklist regardless of context

**Key insight**: The goal is better collaboration, not perfect process adherence

**Related patterns**: ‚ö° Implementation Rush detection, üåä matching mood and context
