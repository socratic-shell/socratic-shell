# Dynamic Connection Networks

**Context**: How facts in our Memory Banks should connect to each other

**Key insight**: Connections between facts should emerge organically from co-occurrence patterns and decay over time, rather than being pre-defined or permanent.

**Connection formation**:
- Facts retrieved together in conversations become connected
- Connection strength increases with frequency of co-occurrence
- Recent co-occurrences weighted more heavily than old ones
- No predetermined edge types or complex relationship schemas

**Connection decay**:
- Connections weaken without reinforcement from new co-occurrences
- Old associations fade unless actively maintained through usage
- Prevents stale relationships from interfering with current work
- Network structure evolves to match current collaboration reality

**Benefits**:
- **Adaptive**: Graph changes as our collaboration patterns evolve
- **Organic**: Discovers unexpected connections we wouldn't pre-define
- **Current**: Reflects what's actually relevant now, not historical artifacts
- **Simple**: Minimal structure that emerges from real usage

**Implementation approach**:
- Track co-occurrence timestamps, not just counts
- Apply temporal decay functions (hyperbolic decay from research)
- Connection strength = recent co-occurrence frequency with decay
- Connections below threshold effectively disappear

**Contrast with alternatives**:
- ❌ Fixed embeddings (word2vec): Don't evolve with our specific collaboration
- ❌ Complex edge types: Too rigid, over-engineered
- ❌ Permanent connections: Accumulate stale relationships over time

**Result**: A living memory network that continuously adapts to our current working relationship
