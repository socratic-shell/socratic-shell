# Hippo: AI-Generated Salient Insights

*A design sketch for atomic memory through reinforcement learning*

## The Core Idea

Hippo is an AI-generated insight system that captures small, atomic observations during collaborative work and uses reinforcement learning to surface the most valuable ones over time. Unlike traditional memory systems that store what humans write, Hippo continuously generates micro-insights and lets them prove their worth through actual usage.

## How It Works

### **Insight Generation**
During conversations, code analysis, or collaborative work, the AI generates small observations:

```
Context: "debugging React performance issues"
Content: "useCallback didn't help - likely child component re-renders"
UUID: abc123-def456-789
```

Each insight gets a unique identifier and starts with a baseline relevance score.

### **Natural Decay**
All insights decay toward irrelevance over time unless reinforced. This creates natural selection pressure - only genuinely useful insights survive.

### **Reinforcement Through Consolidation**
During checkpointing moments, you can provide explicit feedback:

- **Upvote**: "This insight was valuable" → boost relevance, refresh timestamp
- **Rewrite**: "Close, but let me refine this" → evolve the content, maintain connections
- **Downvote**: "This turned out to be wrong" → accelerate decay
- **Ignore**: No action → insight ages naturally

### **Graph-Based Retrieval**
Insights form connections based on:
- Being processed together during consolidation
- Appearing together in searches
- Causal relationships (insight A led to insight B)
- Contradictory relationships (insight A was replaced by insight B)

When you search for insights, you get both direct matches and connected "neighbor" insights.

## Example Workflow

**During work session:**
```
AI observes: "User is struggling with async/await error handling"
Hippo records: 
  Context: "JavaScript async error handling"
  Content: "try/catch blocks don't catch promise rejections in callbacks"
  UUID: async-error-001
```

**Later in session:**
```
AI observes: "User found the solution using .catch() chains"
Hippo records:
  Context: "JavaScript async error handling" 
  Content: "Promise chains with .catch() are more reliable than try/catch"
  UUID: async-error-002
```

**During consolidation:**
```
"Here are insights from this session:
- async-error-001: try/catch limitation with promises
- async-error-002: .catch() chains are more reliable
- react-perf-003: Component re-render debugging approach

Actions: upvote async-error-002, rewrite async-error-001 → 'Promise rejections need explicit .catch() handling', ignore react-perf-003"
```

**Future search:**
```
Query: "JavaScript error handling patterns"
Results:
- async-error-002 (high relevance due to upvote)
- async-error-001 (evolved version, connected to 002)
- Related insights about debugging approaches (graph neighbors)
```

## Key Design Principles

### **Atomic Insights**
Each observation is small and focused - a single insight rather than a narrative. This makes them more reusable across different contexts.

### **AI-Generated**
The human doesn't write insights directly. Instead, the AI observes patterns, problems, and solutions, then generates insights automatically.

### **Reinforcement Learning**
Insights must prove their value through actual usage. The system learns what kinds of observations are genuinely helpful.

### **Graph Connectivity**
Insights don't exist in isolation - they form networks of related knowledge that can be traversed during search.

### **Temporal Dynamics**
Fresh insights compete with established ones. Reinforcement refreshes timestamps, giving proven insights renewed relevance.

## Technical Architecture

### **Core Operations**
- `record_insight(context, content) → UUID`
- `search_insights(context, content) → List[InsightResult]`
- `consolidate_insights(feedback_list)`

### **Data Model**
```python
class SalientInsight:
    uuid: str
    context: str  # Conditions where insight applies
    content: str  # The actual observation
    created_at: datetime
    last_reinforced: datetime
    reinforcement_score: float
    connections: List[str]  # Connected insight UUIDs
```

### **Reinforcement Types**
- **Weak**: Reading/searching provides slight boost
- **Strong**: Explicit upvoting during consolidation
- **Evolution**: Rewriting creates new version with maintained connections
- **Negative**: Downvoting accelerates decay

## Integration with Collaborative Patterns

### **Consolidation Moments**
Perfect integration point - "Make it so" becomes the time to review and reinforce insights from the session.

### **Checkpointing**
Natural workflow for providing feedback on which insights proved valuable.

### **Meta Moments**
Could generate insights about collaboration patterns themselves: "This team tends to overthink authentication design."

### **Hermeneutic Circle**
Insights that help bridge part/whole understanding get reinforced through successful application.

## Comparison to Other Memory Systems

| System | Unit | Author | Persistence | Connections |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Journal** | Narrative entries | Human | Time-based | Hierarchical sections |
| **Official Memory** | Facts & relationships | Human | Manual curation | Explicit relations |
| **AI Insights Comments** | Code annotations | AI | Static | Code structure |
| **Hippo** | Atomic insights | AI | Reinforcement learning | Dynamic graph |

## Why "Hippo"?

Named after the hippocampus - the brain structure responsible for memory consolidation. Just as the biological hippocampus decides which experiences become long-term memories, Hippo uses reinforcement to determine which AI-generated insights deserve to persist.

The name is also friendly and approachable, making the system feel less intimidating than complex memory architectures.

## Current Status

**Design sketch** - exploring the conceptual framework and technical requirements. Key questions to resolve:

- How does the AI detect when to generate insights?
- What triggers reinforcement beyond explicit consolidation feedback?
- How do we prevent runaway reinforcement or feedback loops?
- What's the optimal decay function for different types of insights?
- How do we handle privacy and control over AI-generated observations?

## Future Possibilities

- **Cross-session learning**: Insights that prove valuable across multiple projects get stronger reinforcement
- **Collaborative insights**: Team-shared insight pools with collective reinforcement
- **Meta-insights**: AI generates insights about its own insight-generation patterns
- **Predictive surfacing**: Proactively surface insights based on current work context

*Hippo represents a shift from human-authored memory systems to AI-curated knowledge that evolves through reinforcement. The goal is creating a memory system that naturally surfaces the most valuable insights while letting irrelevant observations fade away.*
