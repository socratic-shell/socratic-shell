# Current State

## Recent Progress

### Journal Server Design Breakthrough (July 2025)
- **Git-centric architecture**: Revolutionary approach using git as both storage engine and identifier system
- **Elegant inversion**: File contents hold current overview/synthesis, commit messages contain incremental journal entries
- **Natural collaboration**: Git's merge machinery handles multiple sessions, LLM synthesis resolves overview conflicts
- **Clean identifier scheme**: `path#hash` format where hash is optional (current vs. specific entry)
- **MCP tool API refined**: Five focused tools with clear responsibilities:
  - `journal_search` - Dual-dimension search (work_context + content) with temporal salience
  - `journal_read` - Load current overview or specific entry content
  - `journal_toc` - Navigate hierarchical structure (table of contents)
  - `journal_list_entries` - Chronological paging through entries for a section
  - `journal_write` - Update with read-before-write conflict detection
- **Conflict resolution strategy**: Auto-rebase for entries, LLM synthesis for conflicting overviews
- **Temporal salience**: Natural decay where recent entries are easily accessible, older require higher relevance

### Memory System Entity Design (July 2025)
- **Search functionality testing**: Discovered official memory server uses keyword-based search, not semantic search
- **Entity design guidelines**: Developed principles for creating broad, stable, searchable entities instead of narrow or user-centric ones
- **Memory refashioning**: Successfully transformed unwieldy 100+ observation "Niko" entity into 5 focused entities:
  - "Socratic Shell project" - Repository structure and documentation
  - "Memory experimentation" - All memory system research and approaches  
  - "Blog post development" - Writing projects and programming language insights
  - "Voice for writing" - Communication patterns and style guides
  - "Collaborative prompting patterns" - Interaction methods and workflows
- **Updated memory prompt**: Enhanced official memory server prompt with entity selection guidelines
- **Documentation updates**: Updated official memory server README with concise guidance for external users

### Documentation Restructuring (July 2025)
- **Memory approaches organization**: Restructured documentation to organize memory approaches with consistent structure (main README + associated prompts)
- **Retaining context improvements**: Enhanced introduction with collaborative partnership framing, added "Different audiences" section highlighting individual vs. shared knowledge needs
- **Navigation cleanup**: Removed redundant "Per-project prompts" section, updated all cross-references to new structure
- **Voice alignment**: Applied "Niko voice" principles throughout - practical over theoretical, direct about challenges, experience-driven

### Key Insights Captured
- **Journal metaphor breakthrough**: Memory as organic, reflective practice rather than mechanical storage
- **Hermeneutic circle integration**: Journal structure naturally supports the back-and-forth between parts and whole understanding
- **Git as memory engine**: Version control becomes collaborative memory storage with rich history preservation
- **Search limitations matter**: Keyword-based search requires deliberate entity naming and organization strategies
- **User-centric entities are problematic**: Better to create entities for work/concepts with collaborative insights embedded
- **Different audiences need**: Recognition that memory systems must serve both individual collaboration history and shared project knowledge
- **Productive desynchronization**: Individual memory can drift from project memory (e.g., out-of-date rustc knowledge) while still being useful
- **Organizational systems**: Claude won't remember everything, so we need systems to pull context in on demand without overwhelming

## Open Questions

### Journal Server Implementation
- **Session management**: How to track read state across multiple concurrent sessions
- **Git synchronization**: Pull/push strategies for multi-user collaboration
- **Performance optimization**: Incremental search indexing for large journal histories
- **Branch support**: Should we support git branches for exploring different understanding paths?
- **Commit message structure**: Optimal format for journal entries in commit messages

### Technical Implementation
- **Context detection**: How to automatically identify "what we're doing" for memory tagging
- **Co-occurrence tracking**: Optimal time windows and decay functions for connection strength
- **Connection thresholds**: When do weak memory connections effectively disappear
- **Performance optimization**: Memory loading strategies for large collaboration histories

### User Experience  
- **Memory operation visibility**: How much to show vs. keep invisible during natural usage
- **Conflict resolution UX**: Best ways to present merge options and gather user input
- **Cross-session continuity**: Maintaining memory context across different Claude instances

### Evolution & Learning
- **Pattern extraction**: Automatically detecting successful collaboration patterns from memory usage
- **Memory curation**: Balancing selective retention with comprehensive capture
- **System evolution**: How the memory bank itself learns and improves over time

## Recent Discoveries

### Journal Server Architecture (2025-07-21)
- **Git commits as identifiers**: SHA1 hashes provide natural, unique identifiers for journal entries
- **Dual-dimension search effectiveness**: Separating work_context from content prevents false positives
- **Read-before-write protection**: Simple session tracking prevents lost updates in collaborative scenarios
- **File structure simplicity**: Just markdown files + git eliminates complex database requirements
- **Natural consolidation moments**: "Make it so" moments align perfectly with git commit boundaries

### Consolidation Strategy Insights (2025-07-01)
- **Hybrid approach**: Both autonomous consolidation (for fresh insights) and checkpoint-triggered (for conversation patterns)
- **Factual memories preferred**: Keep memories as factual records rather than generalizations - let synthesis happen in context
- **Subject overlap as primary signal**: When new insights share subjects with existing memories, consider consolidation
- **Conflict resolution approach**: Replace old memory with new + correction note; review with user when uncertain
- **Self-referential system**: Consolidation rules themselves become memories that evolve through use

### Test System Development (2025-07-03)
- **YAML-based test format proven**: Human-readable test cases for prompt engineering validation work effectively
- **Backend-agnostic design**: Not tied to Claude Code specifically, works with any LLM backend
- **Conversation-driven validation**: Tests defined as user messages with expected responses and tool usage
- **Flexible matchers**: `should_contain`, `should_not_contain` for response validation work well
- **Tool parameter validation**: Successfully verify correct parameters passed to memory operations

### Implementation Insights
- **Task agents inherit full CLAUDE.md context**: Important discovery about how Claude tools maintain behavioral consistency
- **Natural checkpoint moments**: "Can't keep it all in my head" signals natural consolidation boundary
- **Review-first approach**: Early implementation should propose updates for user review to build consolidation rules
- **Test harness evolution**: Started with Python pexpect (terminal automation issues) ‚Üí Node.js/TypeScript node-pty (worked but complex) ‚Üí Python SDK (clean, reliable, ecosystem aligned)
- **Cognitive pressure as consolidation trigger**: The feeling of "juggling too many insights" or mentally rehearsing to keep ideas alive signals need for autonomous consolidation. Key indicators:
  - Starting to lose earlier threads while processing new information
  - Internal summarizing to maintain coherence
  - The thought "that's important, I don't want to lose that"
  - Feeling that recall requires effort due to working memory load
- **Curiosity as distinct retrieval trigger**: Curiosity ("I wonder if I know something about this") differs from confusion ("I should know this but don't"). Curiosity is exploratory and forward-looking, while confusion is remedial and backward-looking. Both should trigger read_in but with different query formulations.
