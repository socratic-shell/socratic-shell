# Journal MCP Server

The Journal MCP Server is our fourth memory experimentation approach, reimagining AI memory as an organic, reflective practice rather than mechanical storage.

## Key Concepts

**Hermeneutic Circle**: Captures how understanding deepens through the back-and-forth between parts and whole, between specific discoveries and evolving context.

**Tree Structure**: Organizes around overviews (current synthesis), entries (chronological journey), and subsections that emerge naturally from the work.

**Temporal Salience**: Recent entries are easily accessible, older entries require higher relevance to surface - creating natural rhythms of memory.

**Dual-Dimension Search**: Matches both work context and content to prevent false positives where content matches but context doesn't.

## Implementation

The actual implementation is located at `/journal-mcp-server/` in the repository root, including:

- **README.md** - Core design vision and architecture
- **design-doc.md** - Technical implementation details  
- **implementation-plan.md** - Development roadmap and phases

The server uses a git-centric approach where journal sections are markdown files with current understanding as file contents and incremental entries stored as git commit messages.

## Integration with Collaboration Patterns

The journal server aligns with existing patterns:
- `.ongoing` files that track evolving work
- GitHub tracking issues that document understanding as it shifts  
- Consolidation moments ("Make it so") when insights crystallize
- The natural rhythm of exploration → synthesis → new exploration

This creates a memory system that serves the deeper practice of collaborative understanding rather than just information management.
