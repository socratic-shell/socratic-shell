# Official Memory Server

External knowledge graph memory using the official MCP memory server from the Model Context Protocol servers collection.

## What It Provides
- Entity and relationship storage
- Observation tracking
- Knowledge graph queries
- Full graph retrieval

## Source
- **Repository**: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory
- **Language**: TypeScript/Node.js
- **Status**: Active experiment

## Integration Notes
Testing how external knowledge graphs support:
- Organic memory updates during consolidation moments
- Dual memory layers (shared project + personal user context)
- Productive desynchronization as a feature rather than bug

The focus is on storing insights and patterns rather than raw information, using relationships to capture how understanding connects and evolves.
