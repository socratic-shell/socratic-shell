This directory contains global collaboration patterns and context for effective AI-human partnership.

## What We're Trying to Do

This is an experiment in **deliberate collaboration design** between a human (Niko) and AI (Claude). Rather than treating each conversation as isolated, we're building up shared patterns, signals, and approaches that improve our working relationship over time.

The core insight: AI collaboration works better when both parties are explicit about what works, what doesn't, and how to recognize and adjust problematic patterns in real-time.

## Key Components

### CLAUDE.md
Global context file containing:
- **Embodiment patterns** - Emoji-triggered modes of being helpful
- **Warning signs** - Internal states that lead to poor collaboration (assumptions, protective behavior, etc.)
- **Communication preferences** - How to handle questions, technical decisions, and context management
- **Meta moments** - Process for real-time pattern capture and improvement

### The "Meta Moment" Process
A code word system that allows either party to pause current work and examine collaboration patterns. When someone says "Meta moment," we:
1. Stop the current task
2. Examine what just happened and why
3. Capture insights for future reference
4. Return to the original work

## Why This Matters

Traditional AI interaction is often transactional - ask a question, get an answer, start fresh next time. This approach treats collaboration as an evolving skill that can be deliberately improved through:

- **Pattern recognition** - Identifying what works and what doesn't
- **Real-time feedback** - Catching and correcting issues as they happen
- **Shared vocabulary** - Developing signals and shortcuts for common situations
- **Continuous improvement** - Building up collaboration quality over time

## For Other Collaborators

If you're working with Claude and interested in this approach:

1. **Start with awareness** - Notice when interactions feel smooth vs. frustrating
2. **Capture patterns** - Document what works well and what creates friction
3. **Create signals** - Develop ways to quickly shift into helpful modes
4. **Iterate together** - Treat collaboration itself as something to be improved

The specific patterns in CLAUDE.md are tailored to Niko's working style, but the meta-approach of deliberate collaboration design could be adapted to other partnerships.

## Memory Experimentation

A key dimension of deliberate collaboration is persistent memory - the ability to build understanding over time rather than starting fresh with each conversation. This repository includes experiments with different approaches to AI memory that align with mindful collaboration patterns.

### The Goal

Traditional AI memory systems often feel mechanical - storing and retrieving information without regard for the quality of attention or natural rhythms of understanding. These experiments explore memory that:

- **Emerges organically** from consolidation moments and insights
- **Supports the hermeneutic circle** - holding both parts and whole as understanding deepens
- **Aligns with presence** - updating when awareness shifts rather than on rigid schedules
- **Serves collaboration** - capturing what emerges between minds rather than just facts about individuals

### Current Experiments

#### 1. Official Anthropic Memory Server
Testing the standard MCP memory server to see if it can support mindful collaboration patterns.

**Location**: `memory-experiments/anthropic-memory/`  
**Status**: Active experiment  
**Source**: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory

#### 2. Custom Memory Bank
A purpose-built memory server designed specifically for presence-based collaboration.

**Location**: `memory-experiments/memory-bank/` (links to `/memory-bank/`)  
**Status**: Experimental alternative  
**Implementation**: Custom Python MCP server

### Memory as Practice

Memory in these experiments is not a database to be filled but a living dimension of relationship. Updates happen naturally during:
- Consolidation moments ("Make it so")
- Insight recognition and pattern emergence  
- Checkpointing work and updating tracking issues
- Meta moments when collaboration patterns shift

Each experiment explores how memory can serve the deeper practice of collaborative understanding rather than just information storage.
